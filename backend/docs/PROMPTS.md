Sample Prompts (use exactly as below)

- Remove object: "Remove the pole in the sky. Fill in the sky so it looks continuous and natural; no artifacts; keep colors true."
- Add lighting: "Add warm golden-hour light to the scene, subtle rim-light on faces, maintain realism."
- Replace background: "Replace background with soft bokeh out-of-focus park scene; keep person edges sharp and natural."
- Restore document: "Increase contrast and clarity so text is crisp and readable; remove glare; keep all printed text unaltered."
- Fine details (face): "Subtle skin smoothing only, keep pores and natural texture, remove blemishes but not identity."

Notes:
- Always include keep instructions to prevent hallucinations.
- For masks, ensure bitmap dimensions exactly equal the image sent to backend.
